1.1 I read the other day some verses written by an eminent painter which were original and not conventional.
1.2 The soul always hears an admonition in such lines, let the subject be what it may.
1.3 The sentiment they instill is of more value than any thought they may contain.
1.4 To believe your own thought, to believe that what is true for you in your private heart is true for all men,—that is genius.
1.5 Speak your latent conviction, and it shall be the universal sense; for the inmost in due time becomes the outmost,—and our first thought is rendered back to us by the trumpets of the Last Judgment.
1.6 Familiar as the voice of the mind is to each, the highest merit we ascribe to Moses, Plato, and Milton is, that they set at naught books and traditions, and spoke not what men, but what they thought.
1.7 A man should learn to detect and watch that gleam of light which flashes across his mind from within, more than the luster of the firmament of bards and sages.
1.8 Yet he dismisses without notice his thought, because it is his.
1.9 In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts: they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty.
1.10 Great works of art have no more affecting lesson for us than this.
1.11 They teach us to abide by our spontaneous impression with good-humored inflexibility then most when the whole cry of voices is on the other side.
1.12 Else, to-morrow a stranger will say with masterly good sense precisely what we have thought and felt all the time, and we shall be forced to take with shame our own opinion from another.

2.13 There is a time in every man's education when he arrives at the conviction that envy is ignorance; that imitation is suicide; that he must take himself for better, for worse, as his portion; that though the wide universe is full of good, no kernel of nourishing corn can come to him but through his toil bestowed on that plot of ground which is given to him to till.
2.14 The power which resides in him is new in nature, and none but he knows what that is which he can do, nor does he know until he has tried.
2.15 Not for nothing one face, one character, one fact, makes much impression on him, and another none.
2.16 This sculpture in the memory is not without preëstablished harmony.
2.17 The eye was placed where one ray should fall, that it might testify of that particular ray.
2.18 We but half express ourselves, and are ashamed of that divine idea which each of us represents.
2.19 It may be safely trusted as proportionate and of good issues, so it be faithfully imparted, but God will not have his work made manifest by cowards.
2.20 A man is relieved and gay when he has put his heart into his work and done his best; but what he has said or done otherwise shall give him no peace.
2.21 It is a deliverance which does not deliver.
2.22 In the attempt his genius deserts him; no muse befriends; no invention, no hope.

3.23 Trust thyself: every heart vibrates to that iron string.
3.24 Accept the place the divine providence has found for you, the society of your contemporaries, the connection of events.
3.25 Great men have always done so, and confided themselves childlike to the genius of their age, betraying their perception that the absolutely trustworthy was seated at their heart, working through their hands, predominating in all their being.
3.26 And we are now men, and must accept in the highest mind the same transcendent destiny; and not minors and invalids in a protected corner, not cowards fleeing before a revolution, but guides, redeemers, and benefactors, obeying the Almighty effort, and advancing on Chaos and the Dark.

4.27 What pretty oracles nature yields us on this text, in the face and behavior of children, babes, and even brutes!
4.28 That divided and rebel mind, that distrust of a sentiment because our arithmetic has computed the strength and means opposed to our purpose, these have not.
4.29 Their mind being whole, their eye is as yet unconquered, and when we look in their faces we are disconcerted.
4.30 Infancy conforms to nobody: all conform to it, so that one babe commonly makes four or five out of the adults who prattle and play to it.
4.31 So God has armed youth and puberty and manhood no less with its own piquancy and charm, and made it enviable and gracious and its claims not to be put by, if it will stand by itself.
4.32 Do not think the youth has no force, because he cannot speak to you and me.
4.33 Hark! in the next room his voice is sufficiently clear and emphatic.
4.34 It seems he knows how to speak to his contemporaries.
4.35 Bashful or bold, then, he will know how to make us seniors very unnecessary.

5.36 The nonchalance of boys who are sure of a dinner, and would disdain as much as a lord to do or say aught to conciliate one, is the healthy attitude of human nature.
5.37 A boy is in the parlor what the pit is in the playhouse; independent, irresponsible, looking out from his corner on such people and facts as pass by, he tries and sentences them on their merits, in the swift, summary way of boys, as good, bad, interesting, silly, eloquent, troublesome.
5.38 He cumbers himself never about consequences about interests; he gives an independent, genuine verdict.
5.39 You must court him: he does not court you.
5.40 But the man is, as it were, clapped into jail by his consciousness.
5.41 As soon as he has once acted or spoken with éclat he is a committed person, watched by the sympathy or the hatred of hundreds, whose affections must now enter into his account.
5.42 There is no Lethe for this.
5.43 Ah, that he could pass again into his neutrality!
5.44 Who can thus avoid all pledges, and having observed, observe again from the same unaffected, unbiased, unbribable, unaffrighted innocence, must always be formidable.
5.45 He would utter opinions on all passing affairs, which being seen to be not private, but necessary, would sink like darts into the ear of men, and put them in fear.

6.46 These are the voices which we hear in solitude, but they grow faint and inaudible as we enter into the world.
6.47 Society everywhere is in conspiracy against the manhood of everyone of its members.
6.48 Society is a joint-stock company, in which the members agree, for the better securing of his bread to each shareholder, to surrender the liberty and culture of the eater.
6.49 The virtue in most request is conformity.
6.50 Self-reliance is its aversion.
6.51 It loves not realities and creators, but names and customs.

7.52 Whoso would be a man must be a nonconformist.
7.53 He who would gather immortal palms must not be hindered by the name of goodness, but must explore if it be goodness.
7.54 Nothing is at last sacred but the integrity of your own mind.
7.55 Absolve you to yourself, and you shall have the suffrage of the world.
7.56 I remember an answer which when quite young I was prompted to make to a valued adviser, who was wont to importune me with the dear old doctrines of the church.
7.57 On my saying, What have I to do with the sacredness of traditions, if I live wholly from within? my friend suggested: "But these impulses may be from below, not from above."
7.58 I replied: "They do not seem to me to be such; but if I am the Devil's child, I will live then from the Devil."
7.59 No law can be sacred to me but that of my nature.
7.60 Good and bad are but names very readily transferable to that or this; the only right is what is after my constitution, the only wrong what is against it.
7.61 A man is to carry himself in the presence of all opposition, as if everything were titular and ephemeral but he.
7.62 I am ashamed to think how easily we capitulate to badges and names, to large societies and dead institutions.
7.63 Every decent and well-spoken individual affects and sways me more than is right.
7.64 I ought to go upright and vital, and speak the rude truth in all ways.
7.65 If malice and vanity wear the coat of philanthropy, shall that pass?
7.66 If an angry bigot assumes this bountiful cause of Abolition, and comes to me with his last news from Barbadoes, why should I not say to him: "Go love thy infant; love thy wood-chopper: be good-natured and modest: have that grace; and never varnish your hard, uncharitable ambition with this incredible tenderness for black folk a thousand miles off.Thy love afar is spite at home."
7.67 Rough and graceless would be such greeting, but truth is handsomer than the affectation of love.
7.68 Your goodness must have some edge to it,—else it is none.
7.69 The doctrine of hatred must be preached as the counteraction of the doctrine of love when that pules and whines.
7.70 I shun father and mother and wife and brother, when my genius calls me.
7.71 I would write on the lintels of the door-post, Whim.
7.72 I hope it is somewhat better than whim at last, but we cannot spend the day in explanation.
7.73 Expect me not to show cause why I seek or why I exclude company.
7.74 Then, again, do not tell me, as a good man did to-day, of my obligation to put all poor men in good situations.
7.75 Are they my poor?
7.76 I tell thee, thou foolish philanthropist, that I grudge the dollar, the dime, the cent, I give to such men as do not belong to me and to whom I do not belong.
7.77 There is a class of persons to whom by all spiritual affinity I am bought and sold; for them I will go to prison, if need be; but your miscellaneous popular charities; the education at college of fools; the building of meeting-houses to the vain end to which many now stand; alms to sots; and the thousand-fold Relief Societies;—though I confess with shame I sometimes succumb and give the dollar, it is a wicked dollar which by and by I shall have the manhood to withhold.

8.78 Virtues are, in the popular estimate, rather the exception than the rule.
8.79 There is the man and his virtues.
8.80 Men do what is called a good action, as some piece of courage or charity, much as they would pay a fine in expiation of daily non-appearance on parade.
8.81 Their works are done as an apology or extenuation of their living in the world,—as invalids and the insane pay a high board.
8.82 Their virtues are penances.
8.83 I do not wish to expiate, but to live.
8.84 My life is for itself and not for a spectacle.
8.85 I much prefer that it should be of a lower strain, so it be genuine and equal, than that it should be glittering and unsteady.
8.86 I wish it to be sound and sweet, and not to need diet and bleeding.
8.87 I ask primary evidence that you are a man, and refuse this appeal from the man to his actions.
8.88 I know that for myself it makes no difference whether I do or forbear those actions which are reckoned excellent.
8.89 I cannot consent to pay for a privilege where I have intrinsic right.
8.90 Few and mean as my gifts may be, I actually am, and do not need for my own assurance or the assurance of my fellows any secondary testimony.

9.91 What I must do is all that concerns me, not what the people think.
9.92 This rule, equally arduous in actual and in intellectual life, may serve for the whole distinction between greatness and meanness.
9.93 It is the harder, because you will always find those who think they know what is your duty better than you know it.
9.94 It is easy in the world to live after the world’s opinion; it is easy in solitude to live after our own; but the great man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude.

10.95 The objection to conforming to usages that have become dead to you is, that it scatters your force.
10.96 It loses your time and blurs the impression of your character.
10.97 If you maintain a dead church, contribute to a dead Bible-society, vote with a great party either for the government or against it, spread your table like base housekeepers, — under all these screens I have difficulty to detect the precise man you are.
10.98 And, of course, so much force is withdrawn from your proper life.
10.99 But do your work, and I shall know you.
10.100 Do your work, and you shall reinforce yourself.
10.101 A man must consider what a blindman’s-buff is this game of conformity.
10.102 If I know your sect, I anticipate your argument.
10.103 I hear a preacher announce for his text and topic the expediency of one of the institutions of his church.
10.104 Do I not know beforehand that not possibly can he say a new and spontaneous word?
10.105 Do I not know that, with all this ostentation of examining the grounds of the institution, he will do no such thing?
10.106 Do I not know that he is pledged to himself not to look but at one side, — the permitted side, not as a man, but as a parish minister?
10.107 He is a retained attorney, and these airs of the bench are the emptiest affectation.
10.108 Well, most men have bound their eyes with one or another handkerchief, and attached themselves to some one of these communities of opinion.
10.109 This conformity makes them not false in a few particulars, authors of a few lies, but false in all particulars.
10.110 Their every truth is not quite true.
10.111 Their two is not the real two, their four not the real four; so that every word they say chagrins us, and we know not where to begin to set them right.
10.112 Meantime nature is not slow to equip us in the prison-uniform of the party to which we adhere.
10.113 We come to wear one cut of face and figure, and acquire by degrees the gentlest asinine expression.
10.114 There is a mortifying experience in particular, which does not fail to wreak itself also in the general history; I mean “the foolish face of praise,” the forced smile which we put on in company where we do not feel at ease in answer to conversation which does not interest us.
10.115 The muscles, not spontaneously moved, but moved by a low usurping wilfulness, grow tight about the outline of the face with the most disagreeable sensation.

11.116 For nonconformity the world whips you with its displeasure.
11.117 And therefore a man must know how to estimate a sour face.
11.118 The by-standers look askance on him in the public street or in the friend’s parlour.
11.119 If this aversation had its origin in contempt and resistance like his own, he might well go home with a sad countenance; but the sour faces of the multitude, like their sweet faces, have no deep cause, but are put on and off as the wind blows and a newspaper directs.
11.120 Yet is the discontent of the multitude more formidable than that of the senate and the college.
11.121 It is easy enough for a firm man who knows the world to brook the rage of the cultivated classes.
11.122 Their rage is decorous and prudent, for they are timid as being very vulnerable themselves.
11.123 But when to their feminine rage the indignation of the people is added, when the ignorant and the poor are aroused, when the unintelligent brute force that lies at the bottom of society is made to growl and mow, it needs the habit of magnanimity and religion to treat it godlike as a trifle of no concernment.

12.124 The other terror that scares us from self-trust is our consistency; a reverence for our past act or word, because the eyes of others have no other data for computing our orbit than our past acts, and we are loath to disappoint them.

13.125 But why should you keep your head over your shoulder?
13.126 Why drag about this corpse of your memory, lest you contradict somewhat you have stated in this or that public place?
13.127 Suppose you should contradict yourself; what then?
13.128 It seems to be a rule of wisdom never to rely on your memory alone, scarcely even in acts of pure memory, but to bring the past for judgment into the thousand-eyed present, and live ever in a new day.
13.129 In your metaphysics you have denied personality to the Deity: yet when the devout motions of the soul come, yield to them heart and life, though they should clothe God with shape and color.
13.130 Leave your theory, as Joseph his coat in the hand of the harlot, and flee.

14.131 A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines.
14.132 With consistency a great soul has simply nothing to do.
14.133 He may as well concern himself with his shadow on the wall.
14.134 Speak what you think now in hard words, and to-morrow speak what to-morrow thinks in hard words again, though it contradict every thing you said to-day.
14.135 — `Ah, so you shall be sure to be misunderstood.’
14.136 — Is it so bad, then, to be misunderstood?
14.137 Pythagoras was misunderstood, and Socrates, and Jesus, and Luther, and Copernicus, and Galileo, and Newton, and every pure and wise spirit that ever took flesh.
14.138 To be great is to be misunderstood.

15.139 I suppose no man can violate his nature.
15.140 All the sallies of his will are rounded in by the law of his being, as the inequalities of Andes and Himmaleh are insignificant in the curve of the sphere.
15.141 Nor does it matter how you gauge and try him.
15.142 A character is like an acrostic or Alexandrian stanza;--read it forward, backward, or across, it still spells the same thing.
15.143 In this pleasing contrite wood-life which God allows me, let me record day by day my honest thought without prospect or retrospect, and, I cannot doubt, it will be found symmetrical, though I mean it not and see it not.
15.144 My book should smell of pines and resound with the hum of insects.
15.145 The swallow over my window should interweave that thread or straw he carries in his bill into my web also.
15.146 We pass for what we are.
15.147 Character teaches above our wills.
15.148 Men imagine that they communicate their virtue or vice only by overt actions, and do not see that virtue or vice emit a breath every moment.

16.149 There will be an agreement in whatever variety of actions, so they be each honest and natural in their hour.
16.150 For of one will, the actions will be harmonious, however unlike they seem.
16.151 These varieties are lost sight of at a little distance, at a little height of thought.
16.152 One tendency unites them all.
16.153 The voyage of the best ship is a zigzag line of a hundred tacks.
16.154 See the line from a sufficient distance, and it straightens itself to the average tendency.
16.155 Your genuine action will explain itself and will explain your other genuine actions.
16.156 Your conformity explains nothing.
16.157 Act singly, and what you have already done singly will justify you now.
16.158 Greatness appeals to the future.
16.159 If I can be firm enough to-day to do right and scorn eyes, I must have done so much right before as to defend me now.
16.160 Be it how it will, do right now.
16.161 Always scorn appearances and you always may.
16.162 The force of character is cumulative.
16.163 All the foregone days of virtue work their health into this.
16.164 What makes the majesty of the heroes of the senate and the field, which so fills the imagination?
16.165 The consciousness of a train of great days and victories behind.
16.166 They shed an united light on the advancing actor.
16.167 He is attended as by a visible escort of angels.
16.168 That is it which throws thunder into Chatham's voice, and dignity into Washington's port, and America into Adams's eye.
16.169 Honor is venerable to us because it is no ephemera.
16.170 It is always ancient virtue.
16.171 We worship it to-day because it is not of to-day.
16.172 We love it and pay it homage because it is not a trap for our love and homage, but is self-dependent, self-derived, and therefore of an old immaculate pedigree, even if shown in a young person.

17.173 I hope in these days we have heard the last of conformity and consistency.
17.174 Let the words be gazetted and ridiculous henceforward.
17.175 Instead of the gong for dinner, let us hear a whistle from the Spartan fife.
17.176 Let us never bow and apologize more.
17.177 A great man is coming to eat at my house.
17.178 I do not wish to please him; I wish that he should wish to please me.
17.179 I will stand here for humanity, and though I would make it kind, I would make it true.
17.180 Let us affront and reprimand the smooth mediocrity and squalid contentment of the times, and hurl in the face of custom and trade and office, the fact which is the upshot of all history, that there is a great responsible Thinker and Actor working wherever a man works; that a true man belongs to no other time or place, but is the centre of things.
17.181 Where he is, there is nature.
17.182 He measures you and all men and all events.
17.183 Ordinarily, every body in society reminds us of somewhat else, or of some other person.
17.184 Character, reality, reminds you of nothing else; it takes place of the whole creation.
17.185 The man must be so much that he must make all circumstances indifferent.
17.186 Every true man is a cause, a country, and an age; requires infinite spaces and numbers and time fully to accomplish his design;--and posterity seem to follow his steps as a train of clients.
17.187 A man Caesar is born, and for ages after we have a Roman Empire.
17.188 Christ is born, and millions of minds so grow and cleave to his genius that he is confounded with virtue and the possible of man.
17.189 An institution is the lengthened shadow of one man; as, Monachism, of the Hermit Antony; the Reformation, of Luther; Quakerism, of Fox; Methodism, of Wesley; Abolition, of Clarkson.
17.190 Scipio, Milton called "the height of Rome"; and all history Resolves itself very easily into the biography of a few stout and earnest persons.

18.191 Let a man then know his worth, and keep things under his feet.
18.192 Let him not peep or steal, or skulk up and down with the air of a charity-boy, a bastard, or an interloper in the world which exists for him.
18.193 But the man in the street, finding no worth in himself which corresponds to the force which built a tower or sculptured a marble god, feels poor when he looks on these.
18.194 To him a palace, a statue, or a costly book have an alien and forbidding air, much like a gay equipage, and seem to say like that, 'Who are you, Sir?'
18.195 Yet they all are his, suitors for his notice, petitioners to his faculties that they will come out and take possession.
18.196 The picture waits for my verdict; it is not to command me, but I am to settle its claims to praise.
18.197 That popular fable of the sot who was picked up dead drunk in the street, carried to the duke's house, washed and dressed and laid in the duke's bed, and, on his waking, treated with all obsequious ceremony like the duke, and assured that he had been insane, owes its popularity to the fact that it symbolizes so well the state of man, who is in the world a sort of sot, but now and then wakes up, exercises his reason and finds himself a true prince.

19.198 Our reading is mendicant and sycophantic.
19.199 In history our imagination plays us false.
19.200 Kingdom and lordship, power and estate, are a gaudier vocabulary than private John and Edward in a small house and common day's work; but the things of life are the same to both; the sum total of both is the same.
19.201 Why all this deference to Alfred and Scanderbeg and Gustavus?
19.202 Suppose they were virtuous; did they wear out virtue?
19.203 As great a stake depends on your private act to-day, as followed their public and renowned steps.
19.204 When private men shall act with original views, the lustre will be transferred from the actions of kings to those of gentlemen.

20.205 The world has been instructed by its kings, who have so magnetized the eyes of nations.
20.206 It has been taught by this colossal symbol the mutual reverence that is due from man to man.
20.207 The joyful loyalty with which men have everywhere suffered the king, the noble, or the great proprietor to walk among them by a law of his own, make his own scale of men and things and reverse theirs, pay for benefits not with money but with honor, and represent the law in his person, was the hieroglyphic by which they obscurely signified their consciousness of their own right and comeliness, the right of every man.

21.208 The magnetism which all original action exerts is explained when we inquire the reason of self-trust.
21.209 Who is the Trustee?
21.210 What is the aboriginal Self, on which a universal reliance may be grounded?
21.211 What is the nature and power of that science-baffling star, without parallax, without calculable elements, which shoots a ray of beauty even into trivial and impure actions, if the least mark of independence appear?
21.212 The inquiry leads us to that source, at once the essence of genius, of virtue, and of life, which we call Spontaneity or Instinct.
21.213 We denote this primary wisdom as Intuition, whilst all later teachings are tuitions.
21.214 In that deep force, the last fact behind which analysis cannot go, all things find their common origin.
21.215 For the sense of being which in calm hours rises, we know not how, in the soul, is not diverse from things, from space, from light, from time, from man, but one with them, and proceeds obviously from the same source whence their life and being also proceed.
21.216 We first share the life by which things exist, and afterwards see them as appearances in nature, and forget that we have shared their cause.
21.217 Here is the fountain of action and of thought.
21.218 Here are the lungs of that inspiration which giveth man wisdom, and which cannot be denied without impiety and atheism.
21.219 We lie in the lap of immense intelligence, which makes us receivers of its truth and organs of its activity.
21.220 When we discern justice, when we discern truth, we do nothing of ourselves, but allow a passage to its beams.
21.221 If we ask whence this comes, if we seek to pry into the soul that causes, all philosophy is at fault.
21.222 Its presence or its absence is all we can affirm.
21.223 Every man discriminates between the voluntary acts of his mind, and his involuntary perceptions, and knows that to his involuntary perceptions a perfect faith is due.
21.224 He may err in the expression of them, but he knows that these things are so, like day and night, not to be disputed.
21.225 My willful actions and acquisitions are but roving;—the idlest reverie, the faintest native emotion, command my curiosity and respect.
21.226 Thoughtless people contradict as readily the statement of perceptions as of opinions, or rather much more readily; for, they do not distinguish between perception and notion.
21.227 They fancy that I choose to see this or that thing.
21.228 But perception is not whimsical, it is fatal.
21.229 If I see a trait, my children will see it after me, and in course of time, all mankind,—although it may chance that no one has seen it before me.
21.230 For my perception of it is as much a fact as the sun.

22.231 The relations of the soul to the divine spirit are so pure, that it is profane to seek to interpose helps.
22.232 It must be that when God speaketh he should communicate, not one thing, but all things; should fill the world with his voice; should scatter forth light, nature, time, souls, from the center of the present thought; and new date and new create the whole.
22.233 Whenever a mind is simple, and receives a divine wisdom, old things pass away,—means, teachers, texts, temples, fall; it lives now, and absorbs past and future into the present hour.
22.234 All things are made sacred by relation to it,—one as much as another.
22.235 All things are dissolved to their center by their cause, and, in the universal miracle, petty and particular miracles disappear.
22.236 If, therefore, a man claims to know and speak of God, and carries you backward to the phraseology of some old moldered nation in another country, in another world, believe him not.
22.237 Is the acorn better than the oak which is its fullness and completion?
22.238 Is the parent better than the child into whom he has cast his ripened being?
22.239 Whence, then, this worship of the past?
22.240 The centuries are conspirators against the sanity and authority of the soul.
22.241 Time and space are but physiological colors which the eye makes, but the soul is light; where it is, is day; where it was, is night; and history is an impertinence and an injury, if it be anything more than a cheerful apologue or parable of my being and becoming.

23.242 Man is timid and apologetic; he is no longer upright; he dares not say "I think," "I am," but quotes some saint or sage.
23.243 He is ashamed before the blade of grass or the blowing rose.
23.244 These roses under my window make no reference to former roses or to better ones; they are for what they are; they exist with God to-day.
23.245 There is no time to them.
23.246 There is simply the rose; it is perfect in every moment of its existence.
23.247 Before a leaf-bud has burst, its whole life acts; in the full-blown flower there is no more; in the leafless root there is no less.
23.248 Its nature is satisfied, and it satisfies nature, in all moments alike.
23.249 But man postpones, or remembers; he does not live in the present, but with a reverted eye laments the past, or, heedless of the riches that surround him, stands on tiptoe to foresee the future.
23.250 He cannot be happy and strong until he too lives with nature in the present, above time.

24.251 This should be plain enough.
24.252 Yet see what strong intellects dare not yet hear God himself, unless he speak the phraseology of I know not what David, or Jeremiah, or Paul.
24.253 We shall not always set so great a price on a few texts, on a few lives.
24.254 We are like children who repeat by rote the sentences of grandames and tutors, and, as they grow older, of the men and talents and characters they chance to see,—painfully recollecting the exact words they spoke; afterwards, when they come into the point of view which those had who uttered those saying, they understand them, and are willing to let the words go; for, at any time, they can use words as good when occasion comes.
24.255 If we live truly, we shall see truly.
24.256 It is as easy for the strong man to be strong, as it is for the weak to be weak.
24.257 When we have new perception, we shall gladly disburden the memory of its hoarded treasures as old rubbish.
24.258 When a man lives with God, his voice shall be as sweet as the murmur of the brook and the rustle of the corn.

25.259 And now at last the highest truth on this subject remains unsaid; probably cannot be said; for all that we say is the far-off remembering of the intuition.
25.260 That thought, by what I can now nearest approach to say it, is this.
25.261 When good is near you, when you have life in yourself, it is not by any known or accustomed way; you shall not discern the footprints of any other; you shall not see the face of man; you shall not hear any name;—the way, the thought, the good, shall be wholly strange and new.
25.262 It shall exclude example and experience.
25.263 You take the way from man, not to man.
25.264 All persons that ever existed are its forgotten ministers.
25.265 Fear and hope are alike beneath it.
25.266 There is somewhat low even in hope.
25.267 In the hour of vision, there is nothing that can be called gratitude, nor properly joy.
25.268 The soul raised over passion beholds identity and eternal causation, perceives the self-existence of Truth and Right, and calms itself with knowing that all things go well.
25.269 Vast spaces of nature, the Atlantic Ocean, the South Sea,—long intervals of time, years, centuries,—are of no account.
25.270 This which I think and feel underlay every former state of life and circumstances, as it does underlie my present, and what is called life, and what is called death.

26.271 Life only avails, not the having lived.
26.272 Power ceases in the instant of repose; it resides in the moment of transition from a past to a new state, in the shooting of the gulf, in the darting to an aim.
26.273 This one fact the world hates, that the soul becomes; for that forever degrades the past, turns all riches to poverty, all reputation to shame, confounds the saint with the rogue, shoves Jesus and Judas equally aside.
26.274 Why, then, do we prate of self-reliance?
26.275 Inasmuch as the soul is present, there will be power not confident but agent.
26.276 To talk of reliance is a poor external way of speaking.
26.277 Speak rather of that which relies, because it works and is.
26.278 Who has more obedience than I masters me, though he should not raise his finger.
26.279 Round him I must revolve by the gravitation of spirits.
26.280 We fancy it rhetoric, when we speak of eminent virtue.
26.281 We do not yet see that virtue is Height, and that a man or a company of men, plastic and permeable to principles, by the law of nature must overpower and ride all cities, nations, kings, rich men, poets, who are not.

27.282 This is the ultimate fact which we so quickly reach on this, as on every topic, the resolution of all into the ever-blessed One.
27.283 Self-existence is the attribute of the Supreme Cause, and it constitutes the measure of good by the degree in which it enters into all lower forms.
27.284 All things real are so by so much virtue as they contain.
27.285 Commerce, husbandry, hunting, whaling, war eloquence, personal weight, are somewhat, and engage my respect as examples of its presence and impure action.
27.286 I see the same law working in nature for conservation and growth.
27.287 Power is in nature the essential measure of right.
27.288 Nature suffers nothing to remain in her kingdoms which cannot help itself.
27.289 The genesis and maturation of a planet, its poise and orbit, the bended tree recovering itself from the strong wind, the vital resources of every animal and vegetable, are demonstrations of the self-sufficing, and therefore self-relying soul.

28.290 Thus all concentrates: let us not rove; let us sit at home with the cause.
28.291 Let us stun and astonish the intruding rabble of men and books and institutions, by a simple declaration of the divine fact.
28.292 Bid the invaders take the shoes from off their feet, for God is here within.
28.293 Let our simplicity judge them, and our docility to our own law demonstrate the poverty of nature and fortune beside our native riches.

29.294 But now we are a mob.
29.295 Man does not stand in awe of man, nor is his genius admonished to stay at home to put itself in communication with the internal ocean, but it goes abroad to beg a cup of water of the urns of other men.
29.296 We must go alone.
29.297 I like the silent church before the service begins, better than any preaching.
29.298 How far off, how cool, how chaste the persons look, begirt each one with a precinct or sanctuary!
29.299 So let us always sit.
29.300 Why should we assume the faults of our friend, or wife, or father, or child, because they sit around our hearth, or are said to have the same blood?
29.301 All men have my blood, and I have all men's.
29.302 Not for that will I adopt their petulance or folly, even to the extent of being ashamed of it.
29.303 But your isolation must not be mechanical, but spiritual, that is, must be elevation.
29.304 At times the whole world seems to be in conspiracy to importune you with emphatic trifles.
29.305 Friend, client, child, sickness, fear, want, charity, all knock at once at thy closet door, and say, "Come out unto us."
29.306 But keep thy state; come not into their confusion.
29.307 The power men possess to annoy men, I give them by a weak curiosity.
29.308 No man can come near me but through my act.
29.309 "What we love that we have, but by desire we bereave ourselves of the love."

30.310 If we cannot at once rise to the sanctities of obedience and faith, let us at least resist our temptations; let us enter into the state of war, and wake Thor and Woden, courage and constancy, in our Saxon breasts.
30.311 This is to be done in our smooth times by speaking the truth.
30.312 Check this lying hospitality and lying affection.
30.313 Live no longer to the expectation of these deceived and deceiving people with whom we converse.
30.314 Say to them, O father, O mother, O wife, O brother, O friend, I have lived with you after appearances hitherto.
30.315 Henceforward I am the truth's.
30.316 Be it known unto you that henceforward I obey no law less than the eternal law.
30.317 I will have no covenants but proximities.
30.318 I shall endeavor to nourish my parents, to support my family, to be the chaste husband of one wife,—but these relations I must fill after a new and unprecedented way.
30.319 I appeal from your customs.
30.320 I must be myself.
30.321 I cannot break myself any longer for you, or you.
30.322 If you can love me for what I am, we shall be the happier.
30.323 If you cannot, I will still seek to deserve that you should.
30.324 I will not hide my tastes or aversions.
30.325 I will so trust that what is deep is holy, that I will do strongly before the sun and moon whatever inly rejoices me, and the heart appoints.
30.326 If you are noble, I will love you; if you are not, I will not hurt you and myself by hypocritical attentions.
30.327 If you are true, but not in the same truth with me, cleave to your companions; I will seek my own.
30.328 I do this not selfishly, but humbly and truly.
30.329 It is alike your interest, and mine, and all men's however long we have dwelt in lies, to live in truth.
30.330 Does this sound harsh to-day?
30.331 You will soon love what is dictated by your nature as well as mine, and, if we follow the truth, it will bring us out safe at last.
30.332 But so may you give these friends pain.
30.333 Yes, but I cannot sell my liberty and my power, to save their sensibility.
30.334 Besides, all persons have their moments of reason, when they look out into the region of absolute truth; then will they justify me, and do the same thing.

31.335 The populace think that your rejection of popular standards is a rejection of all standard, and mere antinomianism; and the bold sensualist will use the name of philosophy to gild his crimes.
31.336 But the law of consciousness abides.
31.337 There are two confessionals, in one or the other of which we must be shriven.
31.338 You may fulfill your round of duties by clearing yourself in the direct, or in the reflex way.
31.339 Consider whether you have satisfied your relations to father, mother, cousin, neighbor, town, cat, and dog; whether any of these can upbraid you.
31.340 But I may also neglect this reflex standard, and absolve me to myself.
31.341 I have my own stern claims and perfect circle.
31.342 It denies the name of duty to many offices that are called duties.
31.343 But if I can discharge its debts, it enables me to dispense with the popular code.
31.344 If any one imagines that this law is lax, let him keep its commandment one day.

32.345 And truly it demands something godlike in him who has cast off the common motives of humanity, and has ventured to trust himself for a taskmaster.
32.346 High be his heart, faithful his will, clear his sight, that he may in good earnest be doctrine, society, law, to himself, that a simple purpose may be to him as strong as iron necessity is to others!

33.347 If any man consider the present aspects of what is called by distinction society, he will see the need of these ethics.
33.348 The sinew and heart of man seem to be drawn out, and we are become timorous, desponding whimperers.
33.349 We are afraid of truth, afraid of fortune, afraid of death, and afraid of each other.
33.350 Our age yields no great and perfect persons.
33.351 We want men and women who shall renovate life and our social state, but we see that most natures are insolvent, cannot satisfy their own wants, have an ambition out of all proportion to their practical force, and do lean and beg day and night continually.
33.352 Our housekeeping is mendicant, our arts, our occupations, our marriages, our religion, we have not chosen, but society has chosen for us.
33.353 We are parlor soldiers.
33.354 We shun the rugged battle of fate, where strength is born.

34.355 If our young men miscarry in their first enterprises, they lose all heart.
34.356 If the young merchant fails, men say he is ruined.
34.357 If the finest genius studies at one of our colleges, and is not installed in an office within one year afterwards in the cities or suburbs of Boston or New York, it seems to his friends and to himself that he is right in being disheartened, and in complaining the rest of his life.
34.358 A sturdy lad from New Hampshire or Vermont, who in turn tries all the professions, who teams it, farms it, peddles, keeps a school, preaches, edits a newspaper, goes to Congress, buys a township, and so forth, in successive years, and always, like a cat, falls on his feet, is worth a hundred of these city dolls.
34.359 He walks abreast with his days, and feels no shame in not "studying a profession," for he does not postpone his life, but lives already.
34.350 He has not one chance, but a hundred chances.
34.351 Let a Stoic open the resources of man, and tell men they are not leaning willows, but can and must detach themselves; that with the exercise of self-trust, new powers shall appear; that a man is the word made flesh, born to shed healing to the nations, that he should be ashamed of our compassion, and that the moment he acts from himself, tossing the laws, the books, idolatries and customs out of the window, we pity him no more, but thank and revere him,—and that teacher shall restore the life of man to splendor, and make his name dear to all history.

35.352 It is easy to see that a greater self-reliance must work a revolution in all the offices and relations of men; in their religion; in their education; in their pursuits; their modes of living; their association; in their property; in their speculative views.

36.353 1. In what prayers do men allow themselves!
36.354 That which they call a holy office is not so much as brave and manly.
36.355 Prayer looks abroad and asks for some foreign addition to come through some foreign virtue, and loses itself in endless mazes of natural and supernatural, and mediatorial and miraculous.
36.356 Prayer that craves a particular commodity,—anything less than all good,—is vicious.
36.357 Prayer is the contemplation of the facts of life from the highest point of view.
36.358 It is the soliloquy of a beholding and jubilant soul.
36.359 It is the spirit of God pronouncing his works good.
36.360 But prayer as a means to effect a private end is meanness and theft.
36.361 It supposes dualism and not unity in nature and consciousness.
36.362 As soon as the man is at one with God, he will not beg.
36.363 He will then see prayer in all action.
36.364 The prayer of the farmer kneeling in his field to weed it, the prayer of the rower kneeling with the stroke of his oar, are true prayers heard throughout nature, though for cheap ends.
36.365 Caratach, in Fletcher's Bonduca, when admonished to inquire the mind of the god Audate, replies,—
36.366 "His hidden meaning lies in our endeavors;
36.367 Our valors are our best gods."
36.368 Another sort of false prayers are our regrets.
36.369 Discontent is the want of self-reliance; it is infirmity of will.
36.360 Regret calamities, if you can thereby help the sufferer; if not, attend your own work, and already the evil begins to be repaired.
36.371 Our sympathy is just as base.
36.372 We come to them who weep foolishly, and sit down and cry for company, instead of imparting to them truth and health in rough electric shocks, putting them once more in communication with their own reason.
36.373 The secret of fortune is joy in our hands.
36.374 Welcome evermore to gods and men is the self-helping man.
36.375 For him all doors are flung wide: him all tongues greet, all honors crown, all eyes follow with desire.
36.376 Our love goes out to him and embraces him, because he did not need it.
36.377 We solicitously and apologetically caress and celebrate him, because he held on his way and scorned our disapprobation.
36.378 The gods love him because men hated him.
36.379 "To the persevering mortal," said Zoroaster, "the blessed Immortals are swift."

37.380 As men's prayers are a disease of the will, so are their creeds a disease of the intellect.
37.381 They say with those foolish Israelites, "Let not God speak to us, lest we die. Speak thou, speak any man with us, and we will obey."
37.382 Everywhere I am hindered of meeting God in my brother, because he has shut his own temple doors, and recites fables merely of his brother's, or his brother's brother's God.
37.383 Every new mind is a new classification.
37.384 If it prove a mind of uncommon activity and power, a Locke, a Lavoisier, a Hutton, a Betham, a Fourier, it imposes its classification on other men, and lo! a new system.
37.385 In proportion to the depth of the thought, and so to the number of the objects it touches and brings within reach of the pupil, is his complacency.
37.386 But chiefly is this apparent in creeds and churches, which are also classifications of some powerful mind acting on the elemental thought of duty, and man's relation to the Highest.
37.387 Such is Calvinism, Quakerism, Swedenborgism.
37.388 The pupil takes the same delight in subordinating everything to the new terminology, as a girl who has just learned botany in seeing a new earth and new seasons thereby.
37.389 It will happen for a time, that the pupil will find his intellectual power has grown by the study of his master's mind.
37.390 But in all unbalanced minds, the classification is idolized, passes for the end, and not for a speedily exhaustible means, so that the walls of the system blend to their eye in the remote horizon with the walls of the universe; the luminaries of heaven seem to them hung on the arch their master built.
37.391 They cannot imagine how you aliens have any right to see,—how you can see; "It must be somehow that you stole the light from us."
37.392 They do not yet perceive that light, unsystematic, indomitable, will break into any cabin, even into theirs.
37.393 Let them chirp awhile and call it their own.
37.394 If they are honest and do well, presently their neat new pinfold will be too strait and low, will crack, will lean, will rot and vanish, and the immortal light, all young and joyful, million-orbed, million-colored, will beam over the universe as on the first morning.

38.395 2. It is for want of self-culture that the superstition of Traveling, whose idols are Italy, England, Egypt, retains its fascination for all educated Americans.
38.396 They who made England, Italy, or Greece venerable in the imagination did so by sticking fast where they were, like an axis of the earth.
38.397 In manly hours, we feel that duty is our place.
38.398 The soul is no traveler; the wise man stays at home, and when his necessities, his duties, on any occasion call him from his house, or into foreign lands, he is at home still; and shall make men sensible by the expression of his countenance, that he goes the missionary of wisdom and virtue, and visits cities and men like a sovereign, and not like an interloper or a valet.

39.399 I have no churlish objection to the circumnavigation of the globe, for the purposes of art, of study, and benevolence, so that the man is first domesticated, or does not go abroad with the hope of finding somewhat greater than he knows.
39.400 He who travels to be amused, or to get somewhat which he does not carry, travels away from himself, and grows old even in youth among old things.
39.401 In Thebes, in Palmyra, his will and mind have become old and dilapidated as they.
39.402 He carries ruins to ruins.

40.403 Traveling is a fool's paradise.
40.404 Our first journeys discover to us the indifference of places.
40.405 At home I dream that at Naples, at Rome, I can be intoxicated with beauty, and lose my sadness.
40.406 I pack my trunk, embrace my friends, embark on the sea, and at last wake up in Naples, and there beside me is the stern fact, the sad self, unrelenting, identical, that I fled from.
40.407 I seek the Vatican, and the palaces.
40.408 I affect to be intoxicated with sights and suggestions, but I am not intoxicated.
40.409 My giant goes with me wherever I go.

41.410 3. But the rage of traveling is a symptom of a deeper unsoundness affecting the whole intellectual action.
41.411 The intellect is vagabond, and our system of education fosters restlessness.
41.412 Our minds travel when our bodies are forced to stay at home.
41.413 We imitate; and what is imitation but the traveling of the mind?
41.414 Our houses are built with foreign taste; our shelves are garnished with foreign ornaments; our opinions, our tastes, our faculties, lean, and follow the Past and the Distant.
41.415 The soul created the arts wherever they have flourished.
41.416 It was in his own mind that the artist sought his model.
41.417 It was an application of his own thought to the thing to be done and the conditions to be observed.
41.418 And why need we copy the Doric or the Gothic model?
41.419 Beauty, convenience, grandeur of thought, and quaint expression are as near to us as to any, and if the American artist will study with hope and love the precise thing to be done by him considering the climate, the soil, the length of the day, the wants of the people, the habit and form of the government, he will create a house in which all these will find themselves fitted, and taste and sentiment will be satisfied also.

42.420 Insist on yourself; never imitate.
42.421 Your own gift you can present every moment with the cumulative force of a whole life's cultivation; but of the adopted talent of another, you have only an extemporaneous, half possession.
42.422 That which each can do best, none but his Maker can teach him.
42.423 No man yet knows what it is, nor can, till that person has exhibited it.
42.424 Where is the master who could have taught Shakespeare?
42.425 Where is the master who could have instructed Franklin, or Washington, or Bacon, or Newton?
42.426 Every great man is a unique.
42.427 The Scipionism of Scipio is precisely that part he could not borrow.
42.428 Shakespeare will never be made by the study of Shakespeare.
42.429 Do that which is assigned to you, and you cannot hope too much or dare too much.
42.430 There is at this moment for you an utterance brave and grand as that of the colossal chisel of Phidias, or trowel of the Egyptians, or the pen of Moses, or Dante, but different from all these.
42.431 Not possibly will the soul all rich, all eloquent, with thousand-cloven tongue, deign to repeat itself; but if you can hear what these patriarchs say, surely you can reply to them in the same pitch of voice; for the ear and the tongue are two organs of one nature.
42.432 Abide in the simple and noble regions of thy life, obey thy heart, and thou shalt reproduce the Foreworld again.

43.433 4. As our Religion, our Education, our Art look abroad, so does our spirit of society.
43.434 All men plume themselves on the improvement of society, and no man improves.

44.435 Society never advances.
44.436 It recedes as fast on one side as it gains on the other.
44.437 It undergoes continual changes; it is barbarous, it is civilized, it is Christianized, it is rich, it is scientific; but this change is not amelioration.
44.438 For everything that is given, something is taken.
44.439 Society acquires new arts, and loses old instincts.
44.440 What a contrast between the well-clad, reading, writing, thinking American, with a watch, a pencil, and a bill of exchange in his pocket, and the naked New Zealander, whose property is a club, a spear, a mat, and an undivided twentieth of a shed to sleep under!
44.441 But compare the health of the two men, and you shall see that the white man has lost his aboriginal strength.
44.442 If the traveler tell us truly, strike the savage with a broad ax, and in a day or two the flesh shall unite and heal as if you struck the blow into soft pitch, and the same blow shall send the white to his grave.

45.443 The civilized man has built a coach, but has lost the use of his feet.
45.444 He is supported on crutches, but lacks so much support of muscle.
45.445 He has a fine Geneva watch, but he fails of the skill to tell the hour by the sun.
45.446 A Greenwich nautical almanac he has, and so being sure of the information when he wants it, the man in the street does not know a star in the sky.
45.447 The solstice he does not observe; the equinox he knows as little; and the whole bright calendar of the year is without a dial in his mind.
45.448 His notebooks impair his memory; his libraries overload his wit; the insurance office increases the number of accidents; and it may be a question whether machinery does not encumber; whether we have not lost by refinement some energy, by a Christianity entrenched in establishments and forms, some vigor of wild virtue.
45.449 For every Stoic was a Stoic; but in Christendom where is the Christian?

46.450 There is no more deviation in the moral standard than in the standard of height or bulk.
46.451 No greater men are now than ever were.
46.452 A singular equality may be observed between great men of the first and of the last ages; nor can all the science, art, religion, and philosophy of the nineteenth century avail to educate greater men than Plutarch's heroes, three or four and twenty centuries ago.
46.453 Not in time is the race progressive.
46.454 Phocion, Socrates, Anaxagoras, Diogenes, are great men, but they leave no class.
46.455 He who is really of their class will not be called by their name, but will be his own man, and, in his turn, the founder of a sect.
46.456 The arts and inventions of each period are only its costume, and do not invigorate men.
46.457 The harm of the improved machinery may compensate its good.
46.458 Hudson and Bering accomplished so much in their fishing boats, as to astonish Parry and Franklin, whose equipment exhausted the resources of science and art.
46.459 Galileo, with an opera-glass, discovered a more splendid series of celestial phenomena than any one since.
46.460 Columbus found the New World in an undecked boat.
46.461 It is curious to see the periodical disuse and perishing of means and machinery, which were introduced with loud laudation a few years or centuries before.
46.462 The great genius returns to essential man.
46.463 We reckoned the improvements of the art of war among the triumphs of science, and yet Napoleon conquered Europe by the bivouac, which consisted of falling back on naked valor, and disencumbering it of all aids.
46.464 The Emperor held it impossible to make a perfect army, says Las Casas, "without abolishing our arms, magazines, commissaries, and carriages, until, in imitation of the Roman custom, the soldier should receive his supply of corn, grind it in his handmill, and bake his bread himself."

47.465 Society is a wave.
47.466 The wave moves onward, but the water of which it is composed does not.
47.467 The same particle does not rise from the valley to the ridge.
47.468 Its unity is only phenomenal.
47.469 The persons who make up a nation to-day, next year die, and their experience with them.

48.470 And so the reliance on Property, including the reliance on governments which protect it, is the want of self-reliance.
48.471 Men have looked away from themselves and at things so long, that they have come to esteem the religious, learned, and civil institutions as guards of property, and they deprecate assaults on these, because they feel them to be assaults on property.
48.472 They measure their esteem of each other by what each has, and not by what each is.
48.473 But a cultivated man becomes ashamed of his property, out of new respect for his nature.
48.474 Especially he hates what he has, if he see that it is accidental,—came to him by inheritance, or gift, or crime; then he feels that it is not having; it does not belong to him, has no root in him, and merely lies there, because no revolution or no robber takes it away.
48.475 But that which a man is, does always by necessity acquire, and what the man acquires is living property, which does not wait the beck of rulers, or mobs, or revolutions, or fire, or storm, or bankruptcies, but perpetually renews itself wherever the man breathes.
48.476 "Thy lot or portion of life," said the Caliph Ali, "is seeking after thee; therefore be at rest from seeking after it."
48.477 Our dependence on these foreign goods leads us to our slavish respect for numbers.
48.478 The political parties meet in numerous conventions; the greater the concourse, and with each new uproar of announcement, The delegation from Essex!  The Democrats from New Hampshire! The Whigs of Maine! the young patriot feels himself stronger than before by a new thousand of eyes and arms.
48.479 In like manner the reformers summon conventions, and vote and resolve in multitude.
48.480 Not so, O friends! will the god deign to enter and inhabit you, but by a method precisely the reverse.
48.481 It is only as a man puts off all foreign support, and stands alone, that I see him to be strong and to prevail.
48.482 He is weaker by every recruit to his banner.
48.483 Is not a man better than a town?
48.484 Ask nothing of men, and in the endless mutation, thou only firm column must presently appear the upholder of all that surrounds thee.
48.485 He who knows that power is inborn, that he is weak because he has looked for good out of him and elsewhere, and so perceiving, throws himself unhesitatingly on his thought, instantly rights himself, stands in the erect position, commands his limbs, works miracles; just as a man who stands on his feet is stronger than a man who stands on his head.

49.486 So use all that is called Fortune.
49.487 Most men gamble with her, and gain all, and lose all, as her wheel rolls.
49.488 But do thou leave as unlawful these winnings, and deal with Cause and Effect, the chancelors of God.
